	<h2><u>Childhood Years</u></h2>

	<blockquote><blockquote><p>Growing up, for some unknown reason I always enjoyed riding or even just watching a carousel.<sup>1</sup> I grew up living in a compund with my relatives from the father side.<sup>2</sup> I always enjoyed playing outside, as what they called now <q><i>Larong Pinoy</i></q> like <i>piko, tumbang preso, agawan base,</i> etc., even though I just gained playmates because they are my cousin or my sibling's friends.<sup>3</sup> I'm the clumsy, shy girl in the neighborhood.<sup>4</sup> My parents always taught us that we should always prioritize needs over wants, if you badly want something like toys, you'll have to work hard for it.<sup>5</sup> We didn't really experience being spoiled, if we want to ask them to buy us some toys, we have to behave and sleep every afternoon.<sup>6</sup> I always remember waiting for christmas every year because it is the only time we're we'll have a chance to buy everything that we want because every year, my father would give all of us the same amount of gift certificate that we can use to go shopping all together and buy our toys.<sup>7</sup> Furthermore, since in my father's side, we are only 4 girls, we tend to buy the same thing but in different colors.<sup>8</sup> For some, living with your relatives is fun because, why not? you'll get to have instant playmates which is your cousins, but for me, it's not.<sup>9</sup> Its all fun and games until comparison started, as we grow older, our closeness fade away.<sup>10</sup> It is the opposite on my family in the mother's side, every school break and christmas break, we will all go to our grandmother's house and then sleep there until the break is over.<sup>11</sup> Even though we only got the chance to stick together during school breaks, our closeness doesn't vanished.<sup>12</sup> I'm a lola's child, I grew up with a grandmother, everytime our parents will go to some party at night, our lola, which we call <q><i>lola nanay</i></q>, will be our guardian.<sup>13</sup> During christmas breaks every year, we will sleep at her house and then accompany her at <q><i>simbang gabi</i></q>, she will wake us up at 3:30am for us to go to the church and catch the rosary before the mass starts.<sup>14</sup> I think that's the most memorable memory that I have in childhood.<sup>15</sup> Since elementary our school will hold a monthly competitions for essay, poster making, slogan making, and story making and every students are required to join.<sup>16</sup> At first I just do it because it is required, and since I grew up as a shy kid, I dont really want attention.<sup>17</sup> But since saw that my parents are proud of me, when my teacher asks me if I wanted to join journalism, I agreed.<sup>18</sup> After joining, I experienced some teachers comparing me to my older sister and since then for an unknown reason my confidence goes down.<sup>19</sup> There are many things that happened in my childhood years, but the only thing that I cherished are the things that I when I think off, I can say to myself that <q><em>It is worth it.</em></q> because just like a carousel, <u><b>life is like a song playing as the carousel rotates, it makes everything seems enjoyable.</u></b><sup>20</sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>

	<h2><u>Teenage Years</u></h2>
	
	<blockquote><blockquote><p>In this stage of my life, I remember doing things that I don't really imagine that I can do. I gained new friends, and started to come out of my comfort zone.<sup>1</sup> During this stage, I felt like i'm at the happiest, I get to do what I want even if it doesn't make my parents happy.<sup>2</sup> At some point I feel like I became a rebel.<sup>3</sup> My focus turned from studying to exploring and going out with friends. <sup>4</sup> I tried turning myself into something that the society seems to admired. <sup>5</sup> Since I studied junior highschool at the same school we're I graduated elementary, I get more comfortable to the environment.<sup>6</sup> I still get shy about small things that I do, but I improved a little bit. <sup>7</sup> We still go to our lola's house every vacation and then attend 'Simbang Gabi' just like the old times, but this time I get to be more matured than before.<sup>8</sup> I started to understand every life lessons that my parents taught me.<sup>9</sup> Before junior high ends, my set of friends changed, sinced my old friends doesn't really have a good relationship with my mother.<sup>10</sup> The new set of friends that I got during <abbr title="Junior High School">JHS</abbr>, I believed that are the friends that really help me with different kind of thing, not only in academics but also in life.<sup>11</sup> They are the one who's with me during the time that I decided to transfer school for Senior highschool, we go to different schools together and even though not all of us have the same school in mind, we still remained friends.<sup>12</sup> When senior high school started, I am very scared because of the new environment, and it still shocked me that my first day that time goes so well.<sup>13</sup> I didn't expect to gained new friends that easily. In senior high school, I learned many things like the different cultures and religions.<sup>14</sup> My senior high friends are the one that make me remember how satisfying it is to make your parents proud.<sup>15</sup> I slowly regained the confidence that I lost. I also started to joined fellowships and sharing.<sup>16</sup> For the first time in my life, I get to have someone whom I can call my bestfriend.<sup>17</sup> She knows everything about me and we got each others back all the time.<sup>18</sup> I also met a teacher that made me realizes my own worth, I remember having a group presentation, he said that he will grade it individually and then he will pick students that would be exempted for the quiz.<sup>19</sup> I know that I did my best that time, but because of lack of confidence, I didnt think that I would be picked.<sup>20</sup> After presentation me and my friends are talking about who they think might be exempted while walking to the canteen and I am sharing my opinion about my performance and how i wouldn't be exempted, when our teacher talks behind us and said, <q><em>Have a little confidence in yourself</em></q>.<sup>21</sup> I can't believe that those simple words would help me to boost my confidence and for me to start to believe in myself.<sup>22</sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>

	<h2><u>College Years</u></h2>
	
	<blockquote><blockquote><p>When I first entered <abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr>, I didn't really expect everything to happen easily, I already expected the worst.<sup>1</sup> I am taking Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, even though i'm not really knowledgeable about programming.<sup>2</sup> Unlike my first day in senior high school, it is a bit hard for me to adjust to college easily.<sup>3</sup> The new environment and since I'm from Bulacan, I did really have to live in a dorm.<sup>4</sup> I only have my <abbr title="Junior High School">JHS</abbr> friend with me.<sup>5</sup> Its hard to adjust especially that I grew up living with my family.<sup>6</sup> After 1 month living in a dorm, I decided to try if I can manage to commute from Bulacan to Manila everyday.<sup>7</sup> I commute everyday for almost 2 months, and after that my family decided to let my sister joined me in the dorm since she's working in Quezon City.<sup>8</sup> There are times that you will feel like giving up, but your friends would be there to cheer you up.<sup>9</sup> I met new friends inside and outside the campus that makes my first year memorable.<sup>10</sup> I remember that after the 2<sup>nd</sup> semester of 1<sup>st</sup> year, many of our classmates decided to shift courses, 2 of them are my friends.<sup>11</sup> Then the <abbr title="Corona Virus Disease">COVID-19</abbr> happened, I think that it is the most challenging problem that I faced so far.<sup>12</sup> I'm just starting to adjust to the new environment, and then I would adjust again to the new normal because of the quarantine.<sup>13</sup> I learned to value even the small things that I have.<sup>14</sup> Online class is really stressful, some says that its easier because you're just studying at your house, but its not.<sup>15</sup> It is hard to adapt easily, especially if the network is not stable.<sup>16</sup> Some says that our batch is one of the worst batch because we experienced K-12 and then <abbr title="Corona Virus Disease">COVID-19</abbr> happened.<sup>17</sup> I learned that just liked the carousel ride that I adored when I was a child, sometimes life is full of ups and downs and sometimes it would be steady.<sup>18</sup> It will make you feel like you're in a infinite loop that doesn't stop, but sometimes you will remember that it will end.<sup>19</sup> Just like what <cite>Nelson Mandela</cite> says, <q><strong><em>It always seems impossible until it is done.</strong></em></q><sup>20</sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>
